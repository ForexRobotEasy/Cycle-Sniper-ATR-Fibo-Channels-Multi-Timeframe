# Cycle Sniper ATR Fibo Channels Multi Timeframe

This code is a sample implementation of the Cycle Sniper ATR Fibo Channels Multi Timeframe indicator. The indicator provides a visual representation of price movements based on either ATR (Average True Range) levels or the slope of a median line.

## Input Parameters

The following input parameters can be adjusted by the user:

- `useATRLevels` (boolean): Option to choose between ATR Levels or Median Line
- `useMedianLine` (boolean): If Median Line is selected, the indicator should draw arrows when the slope of the median line changes
- `atrLevel1` (integer): User-selected ATR Level Line 1
- `atrLevel2` (integer): User-selected ATR Level Line 2
- `atrLevel3` (integer): User-selected ATR Level Line 3

## Functionality

The code consists of three main functions: `OnInit()`, `OnDeinit()`, and `OnStart()`. 

### OnInit()

This function is executed once when the indicator is first loaded. It returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

### OnDeinit(const int reason)

This function is executed when the indicator is unloaded. It can be used to clean up any resources if necessary.

### OnStart()

This function is executed on every tick. It checks the input parameters and market conditions to determine if an arrow should be drawn up or down.

- If `useATRLevels` is selected, the code checks if the price hits the user-selected ATR Level Lines. If the price exceeds these levels, the `arrowUp` or `arrowDown` flags are set accordingly.
- If `useMedianLine` is selected, the code checks if the slope of the median line changes. If the slope increases, the `arrowUp` flag is set. If the slope decreases, the `arrowDown` flag is set.

After determining the arrow direction, the code updates the `arrowUpHistory` and `arrowDownHistory` flags accordingly. Finally, it prints the arrow history using the `Print()` function.

## Product Description

Cycle Sniper ATR Fibo Channels Multi Timeframe is a valuable addition to your trading arsenal. It provides a visual representation of price movements based on either ATR Levels or the slope of a median line. This indicator can help traders identify potential trend reversals and generate trading signals.

By using ATR Levels, traders can set specific price levels based on the Average True Range indicator. When the price exceeds these levels, the indicator will draw arrows indicating a potential trend reversal. This can be useful for setting profit targets or identifying entry and exit points.

Alternatively, traders can choose to use the slope of a median line to generate signals. When the slope changes, the indicator will draw arrows indicating a potential trend reversal. This can be useful for identifying the start of a new trend or confirming the strength of an existing trend.
